# ClimateWins
I used Python to wrangle and analyze the weather dataset to determine if machine learning could be utilized to predict future weather patterns. I then created a presentation to communicate my analysis process and my results.

## Objective
![ClimateWins Logo](https://github.com/DawnChism/ClimateWins/assets/157734176/7c5ba9af-a317-4b94-bcda-a4d3b28b5665)

Use machine learning to help predict the consequences of climate change.

Several machine learning approaches were utilized to determine if machine learning could predict future weather conditions and which algorithm is the most accurate.

## Key Question
 ● How is machine learning used? 

 ● Is it applicable to weather data?
 
 ● ClimateWins has heard of ethical concerns surrounding machine learning and AI. Are there any concerns specific to this project?
 
 ● Historically, what have the maximums and minimums in temperature been?
 
 ● Can machine learning be used to predict whether weather conditions will be favorable on a certain day?

## Data
● Dataset-weather-prediction-dataset-processed - The data was collected by the European Climate Assessment & Data Set (ECA&D) and includes weather observations such as temperature, wind speed, snow, global radiation, and more from 18 different weather stations across Europe for the years of 1960 - 2022. 

● Dataset-Answers-Weather_Prediction_Pleasant_Weather - CSV file that contains data that determines if the weather was peasant or unpleasant for each day from 01-01-1960 - 10-31-2022.

## Tools
The data was analyzed using Python and the following libraries:

● Pandas: for data analysis

● Numpy: for mathematical equations

● Seaborn: for data visualizations

● Matplotlib: for data visualizations

● Matplotlib.pyplot: for data visualizations

● sklearn: for machine learning and statistical modeling

● plotly.express: for data visualizations

● plotly.graph_objects: for creating plots

● operator: a set of efficient functions that perform common operations on built-in data types more efficientl

● graphviz: to create graph objects

## Visualizations
All visualizations were created in Python. 

## Folders
The project files are divided between the following folders:

● 01 Project Management: Project Brief & Data Dictionary.

● 02 Data: Separated into two subfolders Original and Prepared Data. These contain the original data frames and the data frames after they have been cleaned and prepared for analysis respectively. (Data files not uploaded to GitHub due to size.)

● 03 Scripts: The Jupyter notebooks containing the coding for the analysis.

## Resources
● The weather data is collected by the European Climate Assessment & Data Set project. https://www.ecad.eu/

● The answer dataset was created by CareerFoundry for use in this analysis.
